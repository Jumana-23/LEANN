In this paper, we present LiteANN, a storage-efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search index optimized for resource-constrained personal devices. LiteANN combines a compact graph-based structure with an efficient on-the-fly recomputation strategy to enable fast and accurate retrieval wih minimal storage overhead. Our evaluation shows that LiteANN reduces index size to under 5% of the original raw data – up to 50× smaller than standard indexes – while achieving 90% top-3 recall in under 2 seconds on real-world question-answering benchmarks.
