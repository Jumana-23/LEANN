Approximate distances, though not fully accurate, are often sufficient to surface the most relevant candidates near the top, enabling early pruning of unpromising directions. We exploit this by using approximate distances to evaluate neighbors during traversal, and exact distances to re-rank only the most promising candidates. This approach achieves high recall while substantially reducing computational cost, thereby lowering overall latency.\nAt the end of each iteration, nodes in \ud835\udc40 with computed exact distances are inserted into \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc44 , which serves as the candidate pool for subsequent expansions.

Although PQ introduces some accuracy loss, our framework compensates by applying exact computations to a small subset of high-ranking candidates, thereby preserving end-to-end search quality.\nFinally, our method is flexible and generalizable. It can incorporate alternative lightweight approximation techniques beyond quantization.

As a result, LEANN frequently fails to meet the minimum batch size required to saturate GPU throughput, leading to inefficient use of hardware resources at runtime.\nTo address this, LEANN introduces a dynamic batching strategy that slightly relaxes the strict data dependency in best-first search in Algorithm 1. While this introduces minor staleness in the expansion order, it significantly increases the batch size for the embedding model, thereby reducing the end-to-end latency per query.\nThis leads to a key challenge: how can we design an algorithm that fully utilizes GPU compute capacity and takes advantage of batch processing [15, 76] without sacrificing search efficiency?",

In contrast, consumer devices are often storage-constrained, making even the metadata footprint of the index structure a significant concern.\nAs discussed in \u00a73, while LEANN avoids storing exact embeddings by recomputing them at query time, the graph metadata used to guide the search process can still introduce substantial overhead. For example, in the datastore described by [56], the index structure alone accounts for over 30% of the total storage footprint.\nTo address this, LEANN allows users to specify a disk usage constraint \ud835\udc36 .

To better understand the effectiveness of our pruning strategy, we analyze the out-degree distributions of the original graph, our approach, Random Prune, and Small M. As discussed in \u00a75, our design explicitly aims to preserve high-degree 'hub' nodes. As shown in Fig. 8, it successfully retains a substantial number of such nodes, whereas the other two baselines fail to do so. This underscores the critical role of hub nodes in supporting efficient graph-based vector search, a finding that aligns with insights from prior work [39, 42, 51].\nFigure 9.

Since the primary bottleneck of our system lies in the recomputation process, as shown in Fig. 11 later, we further explore the potential for latency reduction by adopting a smaller embedding model. Specifically, we replace the original contriever model (110M parameters) used in \u00a76.2 with the lightweight GTE-small model [36], which has only 34M parameters. We evaluate performance on a smaller 2M document datastore using a fixed search queue length of ef=50 , as shown in Fig. 9. The results show that GTE-small achieves a 2 . 3 \u00d7 speedup while maintaining downstream task accuracy within 2% of the Contriever baseline.

As discussed in \u00a73, when disk storage constraints are relaxed, LEANN can materialize the embeddings of high-degree nodes to reduce recomputation overhead. This effectively builds an on-disk embedding cache, reducing the number of nodes that need to be recomputed at query time. For instance, storing just 10% of the original embeddings yields a 1 . 47 \u00d7 speedup, with a cache hit rate of up to 41.9%. This high cache hit rate arises from the skewed access pattern characteristic of graph-based traversal. However, the observed speedup does not fully align with the hit rate due to the non-negligible loading overhead introduced by SSDs with limited bandwidth.",

The tokenized inputs are sent to the embedding server. Finally, LEANN performs embedding recomputation and distance calculation.\nFigure 10.

Graph-based approaches are widely regarded as state of the art due to their favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency [65].

Starling [64] improves I/O efficiency for disk-resident graphs, while FusionANNS [61] enables cost-effective search through coordinated use of SSD, CPU, and GPU resources. AiSAQ [60], LM-DiskANN [46] further minimizes DRAM usage by storing compressed embeddings directly on disk. EdgeRAG [55] alleviates memory pressure by generating embeddings online using an IVF-based index. However, it still incurs substantial storage overhead due to the need to maintain large clusters on disk as dictated by its design, and its performance degrades at scale owing to the high recomputation cost introduced by an inefficient index structure. An alternative approach is embedding compression, such as PQ [29], or more recent methods like RabitQ [23], which offers quantization with theoretical error bounds. Yet, these methods struggle to maintain high search accuracy under tight storage budgets. In contrast, LEANN integrates on-the-fly embedding recomputation with a graph-based index,",

Furthermore, LEANN's methodology can be naturally adapted to alternative algorithmic and system designs. For instance, in a DiskANN-style architecture, one can keep PQ-compressed embeddings in memory, store the graph structure on disk, and traverse the graph using PQ results. Instead of loading exact embeddings from disk, embeddings are recomputed on demand, and final reranking is performed using the recomputed values.",

There are multiple potential solutions to tackle storage-efficient index building. One approach is to pre-cluster the data, then embed and construct the graph structure independently within each cluster. This process is performed sequentially, and for each cluster, the embeddings are discarded after the graph is built. During the search, results from all clusters are simply aggregated to form the final result.",

In parallel, ongoing progress in compact and efficient embedding models is expected to reduce the cost of the forward pass, further accelerating LEANN and broadening its applicability across diverse hardware platforms. Building on our core algorithm, we envision future optimizations that further reduce latency and improve responsiveness.\nBeyond edge devices, our solution has broader applicability. In datacenter environments, where high-dimensional vectors are used to represent each object (e.g., text or image) for semantic search and other downstream tasks, storage quickly becomes a significant burden. Efficiently managing these representations is therefore essential. LEANN introduces fine-grained, on-demand embedding computation, offering a promising strategy for reducing storage overhead. We hope that LEANN will inspire further research into addressing storage challenges in large-scale ANN systems, particularly as the adoption of advanced embedding models continues to accelerate in datacenter settings.",
